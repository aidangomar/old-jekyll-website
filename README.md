This is the source code for my personal website and blog. If you have something to say, either [email me](mailto:gautam@mittal.net) or [file an issue](https://github.com/gmittal/gautam.cc/issues).

### Up and Running
This site isn't really intended to serve as a template for your own blog. If you're looking for a blog template, check out my other project [Nano](https://github.com/gmittal/nano). This website was built on top of Nano, but I've customized and refactored some aspects of it to fulfill my own needs.

However, if you're looking just to run the code, here are some steps that you'll need to take.

__Requirements__:
- [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

First, download or clone the code.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gmittal/gautam.cc; cd gautam.cc
```
Install the dependencies through ```npm```.
```shell
$ [sudo] npm install
```
Fire it up.
```
$ node app.js
```
