      <p class="img-comment">Fluorpar, or calcium fluoride. The original fluorine compound that was discovered.</p>
      In the early 1500s, a German scientist named Georgius Agricola described a mineral called fluorspar. Flurospar comes from Latin (fluere) meaning "to flow". He claimed that adding it to molten metal made the metal much easier to work with. But the uses of fluorspar were not only limited to this. It was also used for glass etching (it became a great etching material when mixed with acid). Fluorspar is actually calcium fluoride, a compound of fluorine and calcium, which is commonly found in nature. Other compounds that were later discovered included hydrofluoric acid. The discovery of these intriguing compounds led many scientists to experiment, and many started trying to see if they could separate the elements in hydrofluoric acid to get fluroine in its elemental form. Fluorine was finally isolated in 1886, by the chemist Henri Moissan. It was first isolated through the electrolysis of potassium hyrdrogen fluorine and anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. Because of Moissan's work in solving the mystery of fluorine, he was later awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The past of fluorine can be broken up into several major events:<br /><br />
      <li>In <font color="#1ABC9C">TURQUOISE</font>: The first fluorspar discoveries are made in 1530 by Georgius Agricola (fluorine in elemental form is still undiscovered).</li>
      <li>In <font color="#F1C40F">YELLOW</font>: The first experiements on fluorspar start in the early 1800s (hyrdofluoric acid is discovered, but fluorine itself as not yet been discovered).</li>
      <li>In <font color="#E74C3C">RED</font>: 1809-1813. First theories of hydrofluoric acid containing an undiscovered element called fluorine are made. First attempts at isolating this new element are made.</li>
      <li>In <font color="#2ECC71">GREEN</font>: 1886 - 1906. Henri Moissan's work led to the first successful isolation of fluorine and his awarding of the Nobel Prize.</li>
      <li>In <font color="#3498DB">BLUE</font>: 1906 - Present. Fluorine experiementation continues and new compounds are discovered as well as new uses for the element.</li>

      <b>Name: </b>Fluorine<br />
      <b>Family: </b>Halogens (Group 17)<br />
      <b>Atomic Number: </b>9<br />
      <b>Atomic Mass: </b>18.9984032 amu<br />
      <b>Density: </b>0.001695 g/mL<br />
      <b>Phase At Room Temperature: </b>Gas<br />
      <b>Boiling Point: </b>-188.1 C&deg;<br />
      <b>Melting Point: </b>-219.6 C&deg;<br />
      <b>Additional Properties: </b>Fluorine is a halogen, and is in the same family as Chlorine, Iodine, and Bromine (all very poisonous in elemental form). In addition, the halogens are all gases at room temperature and are very odorous elements. Fluroine has a pale yellow color, and has a very strong odor. It also is highly corrosive and flammable. It is the most reactive element and combines with every other element except for Helium, Neon, and Argon. Not only is it very reactive, but it is the most electromagnetive element. Finely divided metal, glass, ceramis and water will burn in fluorine with a very bright flame. Some compounds that Fluroine forms include flurospar/fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>) and cryolite (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>). It also forms hydrofluoric acid (HF) and sodium fluoride (NaF). Currently, fluorine (in elemental form) costs about $190 for 100g. In addition, the human body contains about 3 milligrams of fluoride. <br /><br />

      Fluroine is found in the Earth's crust and is the 13th most common element in the crust. The leading sources of these minerals are <strong>China, Mexico, Mongolia, and South Africa.</strong> The element usually mined in compound form, but can be extracted by passing an electric current through a mixture of hydrogen fluroide and potassium hydrogen fluoride.

      <h4>Uses</h4>
      <img src="toothpaste.gif" class="img-rounded img-responsive" />
      <p class="img-comment">Almost all commerical toothpastes today contain fluorides (the active ingredient in preventing tooth decay)</p>
      Fluroine has relatively few uses in comparison to other elements, but it definitely has created a huge impact on today's society. Listed below are some of the most common uses of the element.<br /><br />
      <b>1) Toothpaste:</b> One of the most common uses of fluorine is in toothpaste. It is added in compound form (usually sodium fluoride). It has been proven to help prevent tooth decay and has had a drastic impact on society in terms of making dental hygiene products much more effective.<br /><br />
      <b>2) City Water Supplies:</b> Because fluorides help to prevent tooth decay, it is added to city water supplies in miniscule quantities, to futher help prevent tooth decay among the population. This has had a huge impact in further ensuring dental health within communities.<br /><br />
      <b>3) Rocket Fuel:</b> One of the few uses for Fluroine in its elemental form is in rocket fuel. It is used because it helps materials burn more efficiently, and has helped to make better rocket fuel.<br /><br />
      <b>4) Aerosol Propellant &amp; Air Conditioning:</b> This was one of the biggest revolutionary breakthroughs in Fluroine's history. Fluorine was one of the primary elements in chlorofluorocarbons, compounds which worked well in air cooling systems and aerosol propellants. But later it was found that these chlorofluorocarbons were extremely harmful to the o-zone layer, and alternatives were discovered for air cooling and aerosol sprays.<br /><br />
      <b>5) Nuclear Fuel:</b> Today, fluorine is commonly used in nuclear fuel in the compound uranium hexafluoride. This has caused a huge impact in nuclear fuel, one of today's strongest energy sources.
