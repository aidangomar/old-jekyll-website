Mathematics is truly magical. It's also really important. How important? Well, the entire basis for our understanding of the universe relies on rules outlined by mathematics.

Today, I revisited a very magical series in mathematics: The Fibonacci numbers.

$$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... $$

Now, the easy way to find the next number 
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {1 \over 2a}.$$
