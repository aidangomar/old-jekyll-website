It is time I started actually using my blog. 

My website has evolved a lot since its inception in 2011. Initially, I used it as a fancy landing page with my basic contact information that I could hand out to people. Later on, I started using it as an online portfolio, keeping track of the various projects, hackathon awards, GarageBand mixes, and funky images that I had accumulated. It was a fun place to post my experiments and other snippets of code prior to knowing what open-source software or GitHub was.

I've moved on. A large portion (if not all) of my code is now open-source (or soon to be) on [GitHub](https://github.com/gmittal/). Most of it is documented (not well, but I try to at least keep basic installation / set-up instructions in the READMEs of all of my repos). There simply isn't a need to keep a separate, fragmented portfolio site when I can simply give someone my GitHub username.

[So, what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylXk1LBvIqU) now? Well, I guess I could always go back to the single pager, basic contact site that most of people have. Or, I could actually start writing interesting (or at least somewhat meaningful) blog posts on this site. Personally, the latter option sounds more interesting and fun, which is why I have an announcement to make: __I'm committing myself to writing a blog post at least once a week.__ 

We'll see if it works out.
